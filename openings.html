                  <h2>Ruy Lopez</h2>
                  <p class="size">The Ruy Lopez is one of the most played openings that any chess player will come across. It's almost imperative that any chess player study some of the more popular defenses against the Ruy Lopez and understand some of the key concepts of the opening.</p>
                  <h3>1. e4 e5</h3>
                  <h3>2. Nf3 Nc6</h3>
                  <h3>3. Bb5</h3>
                  <p class="size">From the beginning, white looks to develop his bishop while pinning down black's knight to the king. Although many openings focus on the f7 square early on, the Ruy Lopez is a slower and more methodical approach to attacking black's king.</p>

                  <h2>Sicilian Defense</h2>
                  <p class="size">It is a very aggressive defense and immediately stakes claim at the center, denying white the double pawns on e4 and d4. Many chess champions actually prefer to start with 1.d4 because of how well the Sicilian Defense plays against</p> 
                  <h3>1.e4.</h3>
                  <p class="size">Eventually the c-pawn of black is usually exchanged, opening the semi-open c file for black to bring his queen or rook to and add pressure to the queen side attack.</p>

                  <h2>Italian Game</h2>
                  <p class="size"> This opening can many times become a very quiet and slow game. Both sides of the board look to stabilize without trading off any material.</p>

                    <h3>1. e4 e5</h3>
                    <h3>2. Nf3 Nc6</h3>
                    <h3>3. Bc4</h3>
                    <p class="size">The good news is that there are many aggressive variations that white can play to open the game up. If black plays Bc5 then white can play the Evan's Gambit (4. b4) or the Italian Gambit (4. d4).</p>

                  <h2>French Defense</h2>
                  <p class="size">The French Defense is a sharp counterattacking weapon against white's King Pawn opening.</p>
                  <h3>1. e4 e6</h3>
                  <p class="size">From black's first move, he looks to block the a2-g8 diagonal which is usually a big weakness for black and prepares to take control of the light squares in the center after 2.d5. Some of the greatest players of all time have had a hard time playing against the French Defense because it plays so much differently than a normal black defense.</p>

                  <h2>Queen's Gambit</h2>
                  <p class="size">The Queen's Gambit is probably the most popular gambit and although most gambits are said to be unsound against perfect play the queen's gambit is said to be the exception.</p>
                  <h3>1. d4 d5</h3>
                    <h3>2. c4</h3>
                    <p class="size">The objective of the queen's gambit is to temporarily sacrifice a pawn to gain control of the center of the board.</p>

                  <h2>Caro-kann Defense</h2>
                  <p class="size">The Caro-Kann Defense is one of the most popular openings in response to the King's Pawn Opening.</p>
                  <h3>1. e4 c6
                  </h3>
                  <p class="size">Black responds with 1.c6 with the idea of thrusting forward with d5 on the next move, attacking the white central pawn on e4. The Caro-Kann Defense is one of the few defenses in chess where black can reach equality in the main line and many people would consider black to have a better position.</p>
                </div>

                  <h2>English Opening</h2>
                  <p class="size">The objective of the opening is to apply pressure on the center d5 square without committing the queen pawn or the king pawn. Since the move is a flank move many players like the English because of its hypermodern style of play (using pieces from the sides along with minor pieces to apply pressure and control the center).</p>
                  <h3>1. c4
                  </h3>
                  <p class="size">White's 2nd move depends on black's response. If black does not immediately try to control the center white can fianchetto his bishop with 2. g3 3. Bg2 and white starts to apply even more pressure on the d5 square and gives white the control over the light squares.</p>

                  <h2>Nimzo-Indian Denfense</h2>
                  <p class="size">The Nimzo Indian Defense is an extremely solid defense that is seen at all levels of play. Many players playing as white will try different variations to try to avoid going into the Nimzo Indian Defense lines.</p>
                  <h3>1. d4 Nf6</h3>
                    <h3>2. c4 e6</h3>
                    <h3>3. Nc3 Bb4</h3>
                  <p class="size">Black looks to double up the pawns on the c-file in exchange for his dark square bishop. With the knight on c3 the key defender of the e4 square, black really starts to focus his energy on controlling the e4 and the light squares.</p>

                  <h2>Reti Opening</h2>
                  <p class="size">Many players have a very defined defense as black but against the Reti, black is forced to almost wait and see which opening line white will take. Some of the main opening lines that the Reti will transpose into are the Queen's Gambit, the English, the Ruy Lopez, or the King's Indian Attack. </p>
                  <h3>1. f3</h3>
                  <p class="size">Most players are more comfortable moving a pawn on their first move as white to control the center but the Reti opening uses a flank technique to attack the center with its minor piece and allows for quick castling on the kingside.White also puts pressure on the e5 square which black would like to occupy but white also does not commit to a specific center pawn structure.</p>
                </div>

                  <h2>King's Gambit</h2>
                  <p class="size">The King's Gambit is one of the oldest openings in chess and for good reason. The possibilities the opening presents have intrigued the greatest chess minds for years including greats such as Spassky, Tal, and Fischer. White, on the second move challenges black's center and begins an attack at the black kingside.</p>
                  <h3>1. e4 e5</h3>
                    <h3>2. f4</h3>
                  <p class="size">2. f4

                    Black can accept or decline the gambit. Most players choose to accept the gambit and try to counterattack the now semi-exposed king side of white. If accepted white should focus their attention on the f7 square which is now a big weakness for black. After 2 exf4 white has two good options. The first option is to immediately start the attack with 3. Bc4, putting immediate pressure on the f7 square. The second option is 3. Nf3 which defends against 3 Qh4+ and also starts to develop an attack on the king side.</p>
